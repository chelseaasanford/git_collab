```

## STEP 4: No merge conflicts!

```{r partner 1}
#Sup madi! todays the day!
```

```{r partner 2}
###Hi Chelsea!


### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a subset based on filtering, e.g., 
### size greater than 1 carat or cut is "Ideal"

### hey dude
```

## STEP 6: Uh oh, merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-1}
### Both partners - delete this comment, then write some code here
### to plot, summarize, calculate something simple using the diamonds
### dataset (or anything you like, really)
```

## STEP 10: And even more merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-2}
### Both partners - delete this comment, then write some code here
### to plot, summarize, calculate something simple using the diamonds
### dataset (or anything you like, really)
```
